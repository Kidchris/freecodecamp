          <h2>Story</h2>

          Elon Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He
          has very early on showed a talent for computers and entrepreneurship.
          At 12, he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In
          1988, after obtaining a passport Canadian, he left South Africa
          because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory
          military service and because he was looking for the best economic
          opportunities available in the United States.

        <h2>Study</h2>
        <div id="study" class="items">
          At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University
          and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk
          obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt
          it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path. In
          1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University
          of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in
          economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. After
          leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to
          pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly
          with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two
          days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2
          Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

          <h2>Companies</h2>
        </a>
        <div class="work">
          Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring
          Company. As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product
          design, engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric
          vehicles, battery products and solar energy products. Since the
          company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate
          the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla product,
          the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S
          sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which
          launched in 2015. Model S received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car
          and has been named the Ultimate Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while
          Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every
          category and sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety
          Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a
          mass-market electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and
          unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least
          $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019,
          Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a
          traditional truck and more performance than a sports car, as well as
          the Model Y compact SUV, which began customer deliveries in early
          2020.
          <div id="sep"></div>
          Tesla also produces three energy storage products, the Powerwall home
          battery, the Powerpack commercial-scale battery, and Megapack, which
          is designed for utility-scale installations. In 2016, Tesla became the
          world’s first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company with
          the acquisition of SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power
          systems in the United States, and in 2017 released Solar Roof – a
          beautiful and affordable energy generation product.
          <div id="sep"></div>

          As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the development of rockets
          and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other
          planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first privately
          developed liquid fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further
          history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon
          spacecraft for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most
          powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, completed
          its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s crew-capable version of
          the Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and
          the company will fly NASA astronauts to the International Space
          Station for the first time in 2020. Building on these achievements,
          SpaceX is developing Starship – a fully reusable transportation system
          that will carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond ­– and
          Starlink, which will deliver high speed broadband internet to
          locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely
          unavailable. By pioneering reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the
          long-term goal of making humans a multi-planet species by creating a
          self-sustaining city on Mars.
          <div id="sep"></div>

          Elon is also CEO of Neuralink, which is developing ultra-high
          bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to
          computers.
          <div id="sep"></div>

          He also launched The Boring Company, which combines fast, affordable
          tunneling technology with an all-electric public transportation system
          in order to alleviate soul-crushing urban congestion and enable
          high-speed, long-distance travel. The Boring Company built a 1.15 mile
          R&D tunnel in Hawthorne, and is currently constructing Vegas Loop, a
          public transportation system at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
          <div id="sep"></div>

          Previously, Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading
          Internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and
          directions services.
